=== version history of XML::Compile::SOAP

version 0.62: Mon Nov 19 12:55:42 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- XML::Compile::SOAP::HTTPClient renamed into
	  XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP.
	  It is reworked to extend the new XML::Compile::Transport.
	  Change invisible to WSDL users, but very visible to people
	  who create their own messages.  Some of the trace records
	  changed name as well.

	- swapped arguments of ::Encoding::typed() from
	   (name, type, value) to (type, name, value);

	Improvements:

	- moved README.todo text to XML::Compile::SOAP man-page,
	  because people often use pre-packaged modules and therefore
	  may not see the README files.

	- extended the documentation a lot.

	- implemented XML::Compile::SOAP::compileClient(), which was
	  documented but not present.

	- added transport base class XML::Compile::Transport.

	- compileMessage() accepts pre-compiled READER and WRITERs,
	  not only element types.

	- implemented (and documented/tested) literal and encoded RPC.

	- Encoding::encAddNamespaces()

	- use fake_server to t/wsdl11.t
