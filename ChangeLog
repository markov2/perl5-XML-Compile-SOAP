=== version history of XML::Compile::SOAP

version 0.66: Thu Jan 31 09:30:18 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- the SOAP message is a document, not an element.  This way,
	  we get the right output encoding for free.  Problem spotted
	  by [Gert Doering]

	- more encoding/decoding character-set issues.  Test script
	  in t/30charset.t

	Improvements:

	- details about client-side soap moved from ::SOAP into
	  ::SOAP::Client

	- ::SOAP::compileClient() moved to ::SOAP::Client::

	- example for $wsdl->compileClient() by [Allen Wind]

	- updated the docs, wrt non-existing SOAP1.2 support, triggered
	  by [Allen Wind]

	- initial implementation of XML::Compile::SOAP::Server

	- return multiple elements in RPC-encoded constructor.
	  Needed by [Philippe B.]

version 0.65: Mon Jan  7 11:58:52 CET 2008

	Improvements:

	- do not fail in ::Operation::collectMessageParts() if the
	  input or output part description is missing. [Kaare Rasmussen]

	- support for one-way (WSDL) messages, pushed by [Kaare Rasmussen]
	
version 0.64: Tue Nov 27 11:42:45 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- various improvements in the output of Encode::decSimplify(),
	  the automatic decoded rpc-encoded messages.

	- depends on XML::Compile 0.61

	Fixes:

	- ::Encoding::_dec_typed() confused URI and prefix.

	- rpc-encoded now tests that user's constructed question has
	  a name-space.

	Improvements:

	- updated examples in example/namesservice/
	  WSDL example is now called: has_wsdl.pl

	- added new example/namesservices examples:
	  New pure Schema example: has_schema.pl
	  RPC-literal example: rpc-literal.pl
	  RPC-Encoded example: rpc-encoded.pl
	  and 4 related simplifications, named xxxx2.pl

	- added for convenience: Encoding::encAddNamespace() [without s]

version 0.63: Sat Nov 24 00:14:07 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- requires XML::Compile 0.60

	- ::Encode::typed() now uses selected schemaNS as default, so
	  simplifies the type parameter.

	- ::Encode::element() now also has the 'type' as first parameter,
	  like ::typed().

	Fixes:

	- detection of operation type, where WSDL used prefixes.

	- some improvements and changes where not listed in the changelog
	  for version 0.62

	- fixed ::Encode::typed() when value is already an element

	- WSDL11 headers parsed wrongly. [Gert Doering]

	Improvements:

	- added t/51wsdl11enc.t

	- added ::Encoding::nil()

	- test for ::Encoding::struct();

version 0.62: Mon Nov 19 12:55:42 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- XML::Compile::SOAP::HTTPClient renamed into
	  XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP.
	  It is reworked to extend the new XML::Compile::Transport.
	  Change invisible to WSDL users, but very visible to people
	  who create their own messages.  Some of the trace records
	  changed name as well.

	- swapped arguments of ::Encoding::typed() from
	   (name, type, value) to (type, name, value);

	- WSDL11(::Operation)::prepareClient() renamed into
	  ::compileClient()

	Improvements:

	- moved README.todo text to XML::Compile::SOAP man-page,
	  because people often use pre-packaged modules and therefore
	  may not see the README files.

	- extended the documentation a lot.

	- implemented XML::Compile::SOAP::compileClient(), which was
	  documented but not present.

	- added transport base class XML::Compile::Transport.

	- compileMessage() accepts pre-compiled READER and WRITERs,
	  not only element types.

	- implemented (and documented/tested) literal and encoded RPC.

	- added Encoding::encAddNamespaces()

	- added Encoding::struct()

	- use fake_server to t/wsdl11.t

	- translated some die's and warn's into Log::Report

	  not understood by Perl 5.5 [Slaven Rezic]

version 0.55: Wed Oct  3 22:57:24 CEST 2007

	- first attempt on a full implementation.  Quite some
