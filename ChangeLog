	Fixes:

	- Correcting fault handling. Code and tests(!) contributed
	  by [Jamie Lentin]

	- Requires XML::Compile 0.91, just because it is much better.

version 0.75: Mon Jul 21 09:17:10 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Requires XML::Compile 0.90. Cpantesters [Martin Kutter]

version 0.74: Fri Jul 18 22:01:24 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Reading SOAP failed, because improved strictness of XML::Compile
	  [Jason Tang]

	Changes:

	- require XML::Compile 0.87, which renames option output_namespaces
	  into prefixes.

	Improvements:

	- rename encoder option namespaces into prefixes.  Old name still
	  available.

version 0.73: Tue Apr 29 18:59:42 CEST 2008

	Changes:

	- require Log::Report 0.17, to fulfil promisses of the doc (was 0.11)

	- require XML::Compile::Tester

	- require XML::Compile 0.78 -> 0.81

	Improvements:

	- example how to use WS-Security, contributed by [Alan Wind]

	- refer to mailinglist and IRC, set-up by [Matt S Trout]

	- Test scripts converted to use XML::Compile::Tester.  Cleaned-out
	  t/TestTools.t

version 0.72: Wed Apr 16 13:03:26 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- WSDL schemata passed to new() got parsed twice.

	- schema sources were offered for compilation twice, but ignored
	  the last time.

	- schema mix-up with more than one WSDL object. [Kaare Rasmussen]

	- WSDL11->compileClient did not pass parameters to ::Schema::compile()
	  as was documented [Allan Wind]

	Changes:

	- requires XML::Compile 0.73 -> 0.78

	Improvements:

	- new option WSDL11(schemas).

	- only complain about limitation to SOAPHTTP protocol if no
	  explicit transporter was defined. [Daniel Ruoso]

version 0.71: Sat Apr 12 09:58:05 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Support XML which uses a non-utf8 encoding. Patch by [Gert Doering]
	  The related test needs to be updated (print cannot handle byte-
	  streams)

	- Client does not add Content-Length field. Patch [Drew Taylor]

	- headers were missing, since XML::Compile "reader in list-context"
	  fix.  Reported by [Gert Doering]

version 0.70: Wed Apr  9 15:09:43 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Math::BigInt with GMP caused t/14dec11.t to fail
	  [CPANTesters, Slaven Rezic]

version 0.69: Tue Apr  8 23:48:31 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Trace returned on error was not transformed into an object, and
	  resulted in unwanted undefs.

	- ::Trace->printTimings() did not handle undefs well.

	- Document that SOAPHTTP::compileClient(action) is optional, not
	  required

	- ::SOAPHTTP will use LWP::UserAgent with Keep-Alive on.

	Changes:

	- require XML::Compile 0.69 -> 0.73

	- ::WSDL11::Operation canTransport() implementation was broken,
	  and therefore needed a change of behavior.  Probably invisible
	  for end-users.

	Improvements:

	- Automatic reuse of transport connections for all WSDL operations
	  with the same endpoint(s).

	- New method ::SOAP::messageStructure()

	- New facility method ::SOAP::importDefinitions()

	- Added ::Util::MSEXT constant (MicroSoft Extension Framework)

	- Make XML::Compile::SOAP::Daemon work by extending ::SOAP::Server
	  and ::SOAP11::Server implementations.  Implementation completed.

	- Added TODO file.

version 0.68: Fri Mar 14 17:56:37 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- sender/receiver compile options where not passed to
	  ::Schema::compile()

	- use of ::Transport::SOAPHTTP was not correctly described
	  in its SYNOPSIS [Marc Sebastian Pelzer]

	- SOAP.pm did not use hires-timings

	Improvements:

	- XML::Compile::SOAP::Trace added for simplified debugging.
	  This also simplifies example/namesservice/has_wsdl.pl

version 0.67: Fri Feb  8 09:16:15 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- WSDL types were compiled twice.

	- problems with specifying your own transporter when creating SOAP
	  calls based on a WSDL.

	- upgrade requirement XML::Compile to 0.68

	- ::Encoding::dec()  [decode RPC] tries harder.
	  with help of [Philippe B.]

	Improvements:

	- Pass information about location of type definitions to
	  XML::Compile, for debugging and tracing.

	- ::Encoding::array new option array_type

version 0.66: Thu Jan 31 09:30:18 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- the SOAP message is a document, not an element.  This way,
	  we get the right output encoding for free.  Problem spotted
	  by [Gert Doering]

	- more encoding/decoding character-set issues.  Test script
	  in t/30charset.t

	Improvements:

	- details about client-side soap moved from ::SOAP into
	  ::SOAP::Client

	- ::SOAP::compileClient() moved to ::SOAP::Client::

	- example for $wsdl->compileClient() by [Allen Wind]

	- updated the docs, wrt non-existing SOAP1.2 support, triggered
	  by [Allen Wind]

	- initial implementation of XML::Compile::SOAP::Server

	  input or output part description is missing. [Kaare Rasmussen]

	- support for one-way (WSDL) messages, pushed by [Kaare Rasmussen]
	
version 0.64: Tue Nov 27 11:42:45 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- various improvements in the output of Encode::decSimplify(),
	  the automatic decoded rpc-encoded messages.

	- depends on XML::Compile 0.61

	Fixes:

	- ::Encoding::_dec_typed() confused URI and prefix.

	- rpc-encoded now tests that user's constructed question has
	  a name-space.

	Improvements:

	- updated examples in example/namesservice/
	  WSDL example is now called: has_wsdl.pl

	- added new example/namesservices examples:
	  New pure Schema example: has_schema.pl
	  RPC-literal example: rpc-literal.pl
	  RPC-Encoded example: rpc-encoded.pl
	  and 4 related simplifications, named xxxx2.pl

	- added for convenience: Encoding::encAddNamespace() [without s]

version 0.63: Sat Nov 24 00:14:07 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- requires XML::Compile 0.60

	- ::Encode::typed() now uses selected schemaNS as default, so
	  simplifies the type parameter.

	- ::Encode::element() now also has the 'type' as first parameter,
	  like ::typed().

	Fixes:

	- detection of operation type, where WSDL used prefixes.

	- some improvements and changes where not listed in the changelog
	  for version 0.62

	- fixed ::Encode::typed() when value is already an element

	- WSDL11 headers parsed wrongly. [Gert Doering]

	- added t/51wsdl11enc.t

	- added ::Encoding::nil()

	- test for ::Encoding::struct();

version 0.62: Mon Nov 19 12:55:42 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- XML::Compile::SOAP::HTTPClient renamed into
	  XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP.
	  It is reworked to extend the new XML::Compile::Transport.
	  Change invisible to WSDL users, but very visible to people
	  who create their own messages.  Some of the trace records
	  changed name as well.

	- swapped arguments of ::Encoding::typed() from
	   (name, type, value) to (type, name, value);

	- WSDL11(::Operation)::prepareClient() renamed into
	  ::compileClient()

	Improvements:

	- moved README.todo text to XML::Compile::SOAP man-page,
	  because people often use pre-packaged modules and therefore
	  may not see the README files.

	- extended the documentation a lot.

	- implemented XML::Compile::SOAP::compileClient(), which was
	  documented but not present.

	- added transport base class XML::Compile::Transport.

	- compileMessage() accepts pre-compiled READER and WRITERs,
	  not only element types.

	- implemented (and documented/tested) literal and encoded RPC.

	- added Encoding::encAddNamespaces()

	- added Encoding::struct()

	- use fake_server to t/wsdl11.t

	  Cpan-testers, [Slaven Rezic]

	- XML::Compile::SOAP1[12]::Client's were missing from the
	  MANIFEST

	Changes:

	  not understood by Perl 5.5 [Slaven Rezic]

version 0.55: Wed Oct  3 22:57:24 CEST 2007

	- first attempt on a full implementation.  Quite some
	  interface changes were made; old docs are useless.
